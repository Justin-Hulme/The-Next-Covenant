# Privacy Policy for The Next Covenant
_Last updated: December 26, 2023_

This Privacy Policy describes Our policies and procedures on the collection, use and disclosure of Your information when You use the Service and tells You about Your privacy rights and how the law protects You.

## Collecting and Using Your Personal Data
### Data Collected
This app does not collect, store, or process any personal data. All information entered into the app is stored locally on your device and none of it is sent elsewhere except for when a bug report is submitted by the user. When a bug report is submitted, a copy of the records entered, a list of calendar events, other automatical generated data (none of which is identifiable information), and debug logs are attached to the bug report.
### Use of Your Personal Data
The only data collected comes from a bug report. This data is only used to identify the issue. We never share your data.
### Retention of Your Personal Data
The data submitted with a bug report is only kept as long as it is needed to identify the issue. All other data is stored in the app.
### Transfer of Your Personal Data
Your data will never be transferred to another institution.
### Delete Your Personal Data
All data stored in the app can be deleted by deleting the app. You may also reach out to us to delete any information sent alongside bug reports.
### Security of Your Personal Data
The security of Your Personal Data is important to Us, but remember that no method of transmission over the Internet, or method of electronic storage is 100% secure. While We strive to use commercially acceptable means to protect Your Personal Data, We cannot guarantee its absolute security.
## Children's Privacy
Our Service does not address anyone under the age of 13. We do not knowingly collect personally identifiable information from anyone under the age of 13. If You are a parent or guardian and You are aware that Your child has provided Us with Personal Data, please contact Us. If We become aware that We have collected Personal Data from anyone under the age of 13 without verification of parental consent, We take steps to remove that information from Our servers.
If We need to rely on consent as a legal basis for processing Your information and Your country requires consent from a parent, We may require Your parent's consent before We collect and use that information.
## Links to Other Websites
Our Service may contain links to other websites that are not operated by Us. If You click on a third party link, You will be directed to that third party's site. We strongly advise You to review the Privacy Policy of every site You visit.
We have no control over and assume no responsibility for the content, privacy policies or practices of any third party sites or services.
## Changes to this Privacy Policy
We may update Our Privacy Policy from time to time. We will notify You of any changes by posting the new Privacy Policy on this page.
You are advised to review this Privacy Policy periodically for any changes. Changes to this Privacy Policy are effective when they are posted on this page.
